## Module1 - Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
Learn to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary  classifier for tweets using a logistic regression.

- Sentiment analaysis
- Logistic regression
- Data pre-processing
- Calculating word frequencies
- Feature extraction
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning

## Module2 -  Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes
Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier of your own.

- Error analysis
- Naive Bayes inference
- Log likelihood
- Laplacian smoothing
- conditional probabilities
- Bayes' rule
- Sentiment analysis
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning

## Module3 - Vector Space Models
Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. You'll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.

- Covariance matrices
- Dimensionality reduction
- Principal component analysis
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Co-occurrence matrices
- Vector representations
- Vector space models

## Module4 - Machine Translation and Document Search
Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.

- Gradient descent
- Approximate nearest neighbors
- Locality sensitive hasing
- Hash functions
- K nearest neighbors
- Document search
- Machine translation
- Frobenius norm
